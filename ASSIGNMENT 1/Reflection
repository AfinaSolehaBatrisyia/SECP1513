This poster really brings AirAsia’s journey to life, it’s not just about flying, but about innovation, technology, and real career opportunities. 
As someone who aspires to be a software engineer, I'm excited to get a glimpse into their daily life especially the part about WFH myths.
A lot of people think working from home is all about freedom, but the reality is, it still takes structure, discipline, 
and good communication to stay productive and give the best result.

I also love how AirAsia fosters a culture where everyone works as equals. 
There’s no rigid hierarchy, just collaboration and teamwork, which makes the workplace feel more welcoming and foster friendships among employees. 
The clear career paths and internship details are super helpful, especially for students trying to figure out their next steps. 
But beyond that, the message about stepping out of your comfort zone, being proactive, and constantly learning really hit home.

This isn’t just a poster about job opportunities, it’s about growth, mindset, and finding your place in a fast-changing world. 
It’s both inspiring and practical, making you feel like you can actually take that next step and ace it.
