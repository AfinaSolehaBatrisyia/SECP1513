The PC maintenance workshop was a hands-on experience that gave me a much better understanding of how computers work. 
I’ve always known the basics, but actually taking apart a PC and putting it back together made everything feel more real. 
At first, I was a bit nervous handling the components, but step by step, it all started to make sense.

This is the step by step how to disassemble the PC:
1. Open the case, use screwdrivers
2. Detach cables (in blue and orange colour) except cables at the wall of the PC.
3. Loosen and take out the power supply.
4. Take out the RAM (you can see the total gb of the RAM at the white section, for this pc it has 4GB)
5. Take out the hard disk (total 250GB)
6. Take out the fan

Reassembling the PC was really satisfying because I could see how all the parts work together. 
The workshop also covered basic troubleshooting, which I know will come in handy if I ever run into hardware issues. 
Our group failed to turn on the computer for the first time, but after consulting, we successfully turn on the computer with our PC 
that we assembled.
Overall, I walked away with way more confidence in handling PC components, and now, building or upgrading a PC doesn’t feel as intimidating. 
It was a great experience, and I can’t wait to put these skills to use!
