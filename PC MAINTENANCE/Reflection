The PC maintenance workshop was a hands-on experience that gave me a much better understanding of how computers work. 
I’ve always known the basics, but actually taking apart a PC and putting it back together made everything feel more real. 
At first, I was a bit nervous handling the components, but step by step, it all started to make sense.

We started by grounding ourselves to avoid static damage, then carefully removed the side panel of the case. 
The first step was detaching the power supply and unplugging all cables. 
Next, we removed the RAM, storage drives, and graphics card, making sure to handle them properly. 
The trickiest part was taking out the CPU, as it’s delicate and needs careful handling. 
After that, we cleaned the components, reapplied thermal paste to the CPU, and reassembled everything in reverse order—installing the motherboard, 
CPU, cooling system, RAM, and drives before reconnecting power cables and ensuring proper cable management.

Reassembling the PC was really satisfying because I could see how all the parts work together. 
The workshop also covered basic troubleshooting, which I know will come in handy if I ever run into hardware issues. 
Overall, I walked away with way more confidence in handling PC components, and now, building or upgrading a PC doesn’t feel as intimidating. 
It was a great experience, and I can’t wait to put these skills to use!
