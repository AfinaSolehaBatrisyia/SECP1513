Working on this Design Thinking project was honestly a mix of excitement and challenge. 
At first, the process felt a bit overwhelming, breaking down problems, figuring out user needs, and coming up with creative solutions. 
But as we went through each stage, I started to see how valuable this approach is. 
It wasn’t just about designing an app, it was about understanding real people, their struggles, and how we could create something meaningful to help them.

One of the biggest things I learned was the importance of empathy. 
Before this, I never really thought about how crucial it is to put yourself in the users’ shoes. 
Talking to people with physical disabilities and hearing about their daily struggles made me realize how much even small improvements can change lives. 
It completely shifted how I approach problem-solving—not just in this project, but in general.

I also realized that having a great idea isn’t enough. 
Execution is just as important. We had to keep refining our concepts, getting feedback, and improving our design to make sure it was actually useful. 
It showed me that innovation isn’t about coming up with one big idea—it’s about continuously learning and adapting.

Overall, this project gave me a whole new appreciation for design thinking and how creativity can be used to solve real-world problems. 
It also showed me how important teamwork is, since everyone brought different perspectives that made our final product better. 
Looking back, I’m really proud of what we created, and I know that everything I’ve learned—about problem-solving, collaboration, 
and thinking from a user’s perspective—will help me in the future.
