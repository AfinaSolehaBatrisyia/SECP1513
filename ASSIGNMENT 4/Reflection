Reading this newsletter changed how I see Telekom Malaysia (TM). 
I used to think of them as just an internet provider, but they’re leading the way in bringing 5G, AI, and smart tech to Malaysia. 
It’s wild to see how things like smart traffic systems and AI-driven security are already making cities safer and more efficient.

What really stood out was how digital infrastructure is more than just fast internet, it’s about changing how we live and work. 
The potential of 5G to transform industries like healthcare and manufacturing blew my mind. 
It made me realize how connected and tech-driven our world is becoming.

I also found the focus on continuous learning inspiring. 
It was a good reminder that to succeed in tech, you’ve got to stay curious, keep growing and dont forget to seek help from others. 
Overall, the newsletter was more than just info, it was motivating. 
It got me excited about what future holds and how we can be a part of it.
