The industry visit was an insightful experience. It really opened my eyes to how things work behind the scenes. 
I got to see the team behind the UTMsmart app, the people managing the university’s WiFi, and so much more. 
It made me realize just how much effort and coordination go into keeping everything running smoothly.

What stood out the most was seeing how teamwork plays a huge role in a professional setting. 
The way everyone communicated and worked together showed me how a good work environment leads to better results. 
It also made me appreciate the skills and techniques we’re learning in class because I can now see how they’ll actually be useful in the real world.

This visit gave me a clearer idea of what it’s like to work in the IT industry and motivated me to keep improving my skills. 
It was really inspiring to see professionals in action, and it made me even more excited about my future in this field!
