Attending the industry talk was honestly a game-changer for me. 
It wasn’t just another lecture, it was a real wake-up call about what it actually takes to succeed in IT. 
Listening to Encik Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Encik Nik Mohd Habibullah share their experiences made me realize that 
the industry isn’t just about being a great programmer, it’s about problem-solving, leadership, and continuously pushing yourself to improve.

One thing that really stuck with me was how important it is to balance technical skills with soft skills. 
Sure, being good at Python, Java, and C++ is essential, but knowing how to communicate, work in a team, and think critically is just as crucial. 
I also loved the part about entrepreneurship—especially the IRPA (Identify, Research, Prepare, Apply) approach. 
It made me rethink how I should plan my career, rather than just hoping things fall into place.

Another big takeaway for me was stepping out of my comfort zone. 
It’s easy to just focus on assignments and exams, but if I really want to stand out, I need to participate in competitions, 
attend more industry events, and connect with people who can help me grow.
This talk made me realize that success isn’t just about what I learn in class, it’s about staying curious, taking risks, and always looking for ways to improve. 
I walked away from this session feeling inspired and motivated to take my future more seriously.
